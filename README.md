# 🌟 Nova - AI Voice Assistant (Python)

**Nova** is a smart, voice-controlled personal assistant built in Python. She responds to voice commands, automates common tasks, speaks naturally using text-to-speech, and helps boost daily productivity.

This project is part of my journey to rebuild from scratch and create real-world tools using Python — with passion, purpose, and persistence. 💻🔥
